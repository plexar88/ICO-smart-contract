## ICO smart contract

Simple ICO smart contract.
This smart contract allows you to conduct a fundraising event like ICO for various projects. Implemented such features as softcup, refund, bounty, etc.
More detail information about this smart contract read in pdf files.

How to create, setup and upload smart contract to TON network:
#### 1. Compile lite-client as described [here](https://test.ton.org/README.txt)

Using *.fif scripts in folder "fift" do follow:

#### 2. Create wallet call it owner_wallet.

    $ <build-directory>/crypto/fift -I<source-directory>/crypto/fift/lib -s <this-directory>/fift/new-wallet.fif 0 owner_wallet

#### 3.Create second wallet and call it dest_wallet. 

    $ <build-directory>/crypto/fift -I<source-directory>/crypto/fift/lib -s <this-directory>/fift/new-wallet.fif 0 dest_wallet
  
Now we need to setup ICO smart contract. We know owner_wallet and dest_wallet addresses. Also we need find out date start and date end of ICO in unixtimestamp format. You can use this [site](https://www.unixtimestamp.com) to do it.
For example, we want to sell tokens in 4 stages. Each stage have some amount of tokens by some price.

stage | tokens | price 
------|--------|-------
  1   | 500000 | 1000 
  2   | 500000 | 1500 
  3   | 500000 | 2000 
  4   | 500000 | 2500

Next settings: softcup is 3000000000, date start - 1576972800, date end - 1579651200, Currency id - 239, storage fee - 123000, bounty percent - 11,34% of sold tokens.

Let's setup ICO smart contract. 
Run in console follow command, replaced directories to your one.

    <build-directory>/crypto/fift -I<source-directory>/crypto/fift/lib -s <this-directory>/fift/setup-smc.fif 0 <owner_wallet> <dest_wallet> 3000000000 1576972800 1579651200 239 123000 1134 500000 1000 500000 1500 500000 2000 500000 2500

Pay attention, that stage info is last parameters and going after bounty percent which is multiplied by a hundred (1134).
This action will show smart contract addresses and will produce .boc file. Send 1 gram to init address of smart contract, then upload .boc file with lite-client (sendfile command).

Now smart contract ready to use.
You can send bounty stake to some wallet. Smart contract controlled from owner wallet, which you specified when setting up a smart contract. This process is simple sending small amount of grams to smart contract with control message. Unused grams will return back to your wallet. There are two control messages - `enroll_bounty` and `finalize_ico`. One more message `current_stage` may used by users to buy tokens by price current stage only (_see pdf documentation_). To form a transaction with this messages you need to use the `wallet.fif` script that you usually use to transfer funds, but attaching a boc file to it with the corresponding command as message body. Files `current_stage.boc` and `finalize_ico.boc` contain simple one-byte command. File `send-bounty-msg.boc` should be created using script `send_bounty.fif`. This script accept such parameters as destination wallet and bounty stake amount. Messages `enroll_bounty` and `finalize_ico` accepted from `owner_wallet` only.
